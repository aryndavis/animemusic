## About This Project

This project was inspired by my journey learning how to take care of multiple species of plants and not being able to find a resource to answer basic and common questions on how to care for these plants. Many websites have too many ads or too much content to sift through, so this is designed to take in the blocks of text that are provided on these sites and extract only the most necessary information.
